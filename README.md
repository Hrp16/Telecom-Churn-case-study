# Telecom-Churn-case-study
With 21 predictor variables we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not. In telecom terminology, this is referred to as churning and not churning, respectively.

# Problem Statment
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:
- Demographics (age, gender etc.)
- Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
- Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not.
